# MarvelComicsDemo
iOS demo of Marvel Comics API

## Currently used libraries: ##

SDWebImage, brought in via Swift Package Manager

## Future improvements: ##

- Try to cache more data better, whether via CoreData or some other library/framework

- Comic variants offer an opportunity to have image views in a swipeable collection view, or page controller

- I'd love to display more user-readable data from the JSON response, which I would do in a table or collection view, using UITextViews to scroll longer blocks of text.
